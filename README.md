![People working together](ps_images/hands-people-woman-working.jpg)> No industry can sustain itself if it doesn’t master the art of cultivating new talent—an art that requires close ties between practitioners and educators. [(Walter 2009)](http://alistapart.com/article/brighter-horizons-for-web-education)## IntroductionAs a experiment we will be running short problem solving session within a 1 hour class for our 3rd year (Level 6) students as part of the delivery of a unit called Web Design for Industry SWD600 which aims to get students "work ready".## RationalCommunication, teamwork and problem solving are central skills for resilience in an ever changing work place. 

> Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. [(Jo Johnson MP Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation 2015)](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/teaching-at-the-heart-of-the-system)

## What sort of problem? 
Ideally it will be a mini problem that can be handled in a short space of time (30min). It could be a marketing problem, branding, user experience, project management, interface design, design concept etc.
## How can I get involved?Produce a 3min (approx.) video to introduce yourself/company before moving on to explain the context of the problem to be solved. Don't worry about the quality, you can shoot it on your phone. This is what we call in education the [Flipped Classroom](https://youtu.be/s0ECkz8z2pU).

YouTube## How will it work?Students will have the opportunity to view the video before class (The Flip) and as a recap they will watch one more time at the beginning of the class.## Set-up and resourcesThey will then spend 30 minutes working in teams to solve the solve the problem using pens, pages, stick-it notes and white boards.
