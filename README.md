> No industry can sustain itself if it doesn’t master the art of cultivating new talent—an art that requires close ties between practitioners and educators. [(Walter 2009)](http://alistapart.com/article/brighter-horizons-for-web-education)

## Introduction
We have a brand-new module that goes out to all third-year students in the computing subject group at Southampton Solent University corses covered: Software Engineering, Digital Design and web Development, Computing, Network Engineering and cyber security

## Rational
Communication, teamwork and problem solving are central skills for resilience in an ever changing work place. 


## What sort of problem? 
Ideally it will be a mini problem that can be handled in a short space of time (30min). It could be a marketing problem, branding, user experience, project management, interface design, design concept etc.

## How can I get involved?
Produce a 3min (approx.) video to introduce yourself/company before moving on to explain the context of the problem to be solved. Don't worry about the quality, you can shoot it on your phone. This is what we call in education the [Flipped Classroom](https://youtu.be/s0ECkz8z2pU).

## How will it work?
Students will have the opportunity to view the video before class (The Flip) and as a recap they will watch one more time at the beginning of the class.

## Set-up and resources
They will then spend 30 minutes working in teams to solve the solve the problem using pens, pages, stick-it notes and white boards.
